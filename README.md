# CallR (Java)
## Overview
CallR is an open-source, object-oriented RPC library and framework that allows implementing and using (calling) services running behind routers and firewals.
It frees you, your organization and customers from the need of configuring any port forwardings on the routers, firewalls, setting up VPNs etc.
## How it Works (The 'Passive Service' Pattern)
These so called 'passive services' run on the protected internal network and instead of listening for inbound connetions on specific port, they do a secure outbuond HTTPS (Secure WebSocket) connection to a publicly available CallR Hub.
Of course securely, over SSL, employing Authentication and Authorization. On the other side CallR Clients also connect to the hub in the same manner.
After that, the clients can invoke the service by sending an addressed request message to the hub. The hub pushes the request message to the respective service through the WebSocket connection.
In the service, the request message is unwrapped into a method call (using reflection) and the result (or any exception thrown) is obtained. The result then is wrapped into a response message and sent back to the hub.
The hub forwards the response message back to the calling client, where it is unwrapped as a result and returned to the calling method (or the exception is thrown).

## Implementing CallR Services and Clients
In this section we'll go through what is required in order to implement CallR services and clients.
Because all the machinery outlined in previous section is implemented in two base classes - `CallRServiceBase` and `CallRServiceProxy`,
all you need is to inherit from these classes and implement your service/client interface.
For an example we'll go with a very simple `Calculator` service, which can add two integers and return the result.
A more extended example, including hosting the service and client can be found under `examples/calculator` folder of the project
### 1. Define an Interface
The first step in the implementation of CallR service and client is to define an interface, which both the service and client will implement. This guarantees compile-time check of the implementation. For example:
```
public interface Calculator {
	int add(Integer a, Integer b);
}
```
### 2. Implement the Service
To implement the service, all you need is to inherit from `CallRServiceBase` and implement the interface defined in (1).
```
public class CalculatorService extends CallRServiceBase implements Calculator {

	public CalculatorService(CallRClient client) {
		super(client);
	}

	@Override
	public int add(Integer a, Integer b) {
		return a + b;
	}
}
```
That's it. All the required functionaity for connecting to the hub, registering the service (as a client of the hub),
receiving the pushed request messages, unwrapping them and calling the respective method is implemented in `CallRServiceBase` and `CallRClient`.
Note the `CallRClient`is passed as a constructor parameter, but you can use any dependency injection method to inject it from the outside as a bean.
### 3. Implement the Client
To implement the client, all you need is to inherit from `CallRServiceProxy` and implement the interface by simply calling the `invoke()` method of the base class, passing any parameters you might have.
```
public class CalculatorServiceProxy extends CallRServiceProxy implements Calculator {

	public CalculatorServiceProxy(CallRClient client, UUID serviceId) {
		super(serviceId, client);
	}

	@Override
	public int add(Integer a, Integer b) {
		return (int)invoke(
				new Parameter("a", Integer.class.getName(), a),
				new Parameter("b", Integer.class.getName(), b)
		);
	}

}
```
